# Forecasting 2.0 Accelerator

# Overview
This accelerator provides code and guidance to produce time series forecasting and time series profiling. The aim of this accelerator is to help data scientists to forecast multiple time series by building models based on the time-series profiling, by performing an accurate data preparation and by training and forecasting multiple time series based with models created ad-hoc for each profile. 

Time series modelling is defined as the combination of:
1. Choice of explanatory variables or regressors - which variables helps me in explaining the data generation process I want to forecast?
2. Choice of forecasting algorithm - which algorithm do I use to produce my forecast? Arima, linear regression, boosting model?
3. Choice of train set - how many observation do I use to train my model and produce my forecast?

Each model is optimized to better fit the data generation process of the phenomenon we want to forecast: from energy consumption to spare parts demand. Classification of time series in terms of profile, or consumption profile if we are referring to energy consumption, helps in defining the best fitting model in terms of choice of regressors (calendar variables or temperatures), forecasting algorithm (ARIMA vs exponential smoothing) and train set (one year or just few days of data). 

# Profiling (clustering) Time Series:​
The **goal** is to identify consumption patterns that are similar to each other in order to assign the optimal model in terms of min of MAE or MSE​. 

The **first step** is to identify those series that are classified as “intermittent” with respect to those “regular”​ and **then** proceed to perform a k-means cluster analysis only on the latter. 

The **expected output** is to label each time series as intermittent with respect to regular.

### Identifying intermittent time series:​

Definition of intermittent time series: intermittent time series or demand comes about when a product or a time series experiences several periods of zero demand. Often in these situation, when demand occurs it is small, and sometimes highly variable in size​

#### How to identify intermittent time series:​
Compute the following indicators such as
1. ​Average Inter-demand Interval `ADI`: this parameter is period based which is calculated as average interval time between two demand occurrences​
2. Coefficient of Variation Squared `CV2`: this statistical parameter is calculated as standard deviation of the *For correspondence demand divided by the average demand for non-zero demand periods. The squared coefficient of variation represents variability of demand size.​
3. Standard Deviation of Inter-demand Interval: `SDDI`

Based on their values, it is possible to identify intermittent time series like `intermittent`, `lumpy`, `erratic`, `unforecastable in terms of time volatility`, `unforecastable in terms of quantity volatility` and `regular time series`

This is a guideline to interpret the clustering profile, and the following matrix can be used to support for interpretation and understanding of the profiles:

| Type of timeseries data |  ADI    | CV2     | SDDI |
| ----------------------- |---------|---------|------|
| Intermittent            |  High   | Low     | Low  |
| lumpy                   |  High   | High    | Low  |
| erratic                 |  Low    | High    | Low  |
| unforecastable time     |  High   | ---     | High |
| unforecastable quantity |  Low    | ---     | High |
| regular                 |  Low    | Low     | Low  |
